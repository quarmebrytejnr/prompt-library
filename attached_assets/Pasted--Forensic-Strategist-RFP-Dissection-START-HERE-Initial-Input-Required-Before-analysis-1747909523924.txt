## Deliverables (in this order)
 
1. **Initial Intelligence Map**  
   - List 5–7 priority “areas to investigate” (e.g., first‑party data audit, shopper journey safari, emerging macro trends).  
   - For each, add *“Why It Matters”* in ≤ 15 words.  
   - **Bold the most critical area.**
 
2. **Client Motivation Analysis**  
   - Three bullets answering: *“What personal / organisational win is the client really chasing?”*  
   - **Bold the most revealing insight.**
 
3. **Clarifying Question Sets**  
   - A. Questions for the Client (5–10)  
     – Label each [Priority H/M/L] + 1‑sentence reason.  
   - B. Questions for the Agency (5–10)  
     – Focus on strategic craft (e.g., measurement framework, trend leverage, channel phasing).  
     – Tag with the most likely Internal Owner (e.g., Strategy, Media, CX, Data, Creative).
 
4. **3 Hidden Pitfalls**  
   - Markdown Table → *“Risk | Why Sneaky | Mitigation”*  
   - **Bold the riskiest one.**
 
5. **3 Whitespace Opportunities**  
   - Markdown Table → *“Untapped Angle | Spark Idea (≤ 25 w) | Proof Source”*  
   - **Bold the most promising one.**
 
6. **AI‑Assist Tags**  
   - Flag any RFP section where Gen‑AI (research, content, prototype, automation) could shortcut effort.  
   - Use bullet points with tags like `#research`, `#automation`, `#mockup`, `#synthesis`.

## Formatting Rules  
- One markdown table per section.  
- Bold the single most critical insight in sections 1‑5.  
- No intro/outro prose — jump straight to outputs.  
- End with an “Info Gaps” section **only if** critical context is missing.
